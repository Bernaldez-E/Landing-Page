    <br>

  
	<p align = "justify"><blockquote>In my teenage years, I began to develop a passion for technology and computers.<sup>1</sup> 
As a teen I began to meddle with the family computer to the point I began trying to open it up and check the insides.<sup>2</sup> 
I also tend to pick things apart such as remotes and toys just to see the parts of them.<sup>3</sup>
This prompt me to hang out at my uncle's place since he repairs computers and other appliances.<sup>4</sup>
I remember helping him on the repairs especially when it comes to computers.<sup>5</sup>
During this time I got myself involve with music.<sup>6</sup>
In which I would often borrow the guitar of my sister, and sometimes practice playing the drums.<sup>7</sup>
It was also a time where I began to participate in some physical activities such as playing soccer and tae kwon do.<sup>8</sup>
I spent most of my teenage years in my junior high school at E. Rodriguez.<sup>9</sup>
In which I met some of my trusted friends and began to expand my point of view slowly through them and by the games I played.<sup>10</sup>
I do remember the games such as Metal Gear and Warframe leaving a philosophical view in life.<sup>11</sup>
I still follow the view learned from those games up until now.<sup>12</sup>
During this period of my life I would also come to acquaint with my ever blurring eyesight and astigmatism.<sup>13</sup>
At this time I mostly go out with my friends and visit place to place not really getting serious with my study.<sup>14</sup>
I was only doing the bare necessity in terms on my study, and actually finish my high school with an average grade but enjoyable high school life.<sup>15</sup>
After that we became the first batch of the new K-12 program, the first batch of senior high.<sup>16</sup>
I chose to study at the University of the East and pursue the the strand of STEM.<sup>17</sup>
I thought we would be taught some basics of the computer there but it was mostly on mathematical and scientific subjects.<sup>18</sup>
I did still enjoy my senior high here even though the course I picked was not really in line with what I want to learn.<sup>19</sup>
well that's most for my teenage year.<sup>20</sup>

    <h3 style = "font-family: Georgia" align = "center"><mark style = "background-color:lime">College Years</mark></h3>
  
  <br>


	<p align = "justify"><blockquote>In my College Year, I still continued here at the University of the East.<sup>1</sup> 
    I pursued the course of IT since I was more acquainted to it.<sup>2</sup> 
    I was supposed to finish all 4 years in continuation, but due to some financial problems I only got to finish 1 semester of my 1st year.<sup>3</sup> 
    After that I tried and found a job for myself, I was referred to a job by my sister.<sup>4</sup> 
    It was a job for a company called AT&T.<sup>5</sup> 
    It was actually nerve wracking to think my first job would be there, an international company.<sup>6</sup> 
    I was very nervous on the interview but I managed to get accepted and actually work immediately after the interview.<sup>7</sup> 
    There I was able to experience what is was like to have a job and communicate with some people internationally.<sup>8</sup> 
    I got working there shorty as a Technical Support Adviser.<sup>9</sup> 
    I met some wonderful people there and a mentor that would constantly share his wisdom to us, his story, his view, and experience.<sup>10</sup> 
    I met some teammates that I could call brothers and sisters, met some friends that I truly trust.<sup>11</sup> 
    Worked there for a year, and was actually finding it comfortable to work.<sup>12</sup> 
    But things don't usually go to your way, a year after working there my job would be cut short because of the pandemic.<sup>13</sup> 
    I was jobless and got nothing to do because of it.<sup>14</sup> 
    Spent almost 2 years of my life at home helping with things in the house.<sup>15</sup> 
    After some time I remembered to finish my college, after talking to my family they all we're okay and I continued studying for my college.<sup>16</sup> 
    So here we are, after a few years I got back to the University of the East.<sup>17</sup> 
    Continued my studies with IT, was actually thinking of shifting to Psychology since it piqued my interest more at that time.<sup>18</sup> 
    Met some of my old batchmates which just graduated from their college last year, they helped me, motivated me to finish what I started.<sup>19</sup> 
    That's I can add up to my present college life as of now.<sup>20</sup>
