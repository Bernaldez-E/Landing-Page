 <h3>Skills</h3>
<ul class="a">
  <p>As for skills, I don't really have a particular set of skills that I can flaunt out. I'm more of the person who likes to know the basics. Like a jack of all trades type of person. For example in the house, I'm mostly the person to call if there's like a problem in some devices. Not just in device's, this can also be with some software. I did have a basic rundown in computer maintenance. Some knowledge in troubleshooting with appliances as well. Well I don't know if you can call this a skill, but I was working before as a Technical Support Advisor for an international company. And I was certified and was actually about to be promoted there, but then the whole pandemic happened and it got pushed down. Well I think that's the gist of it for me in the skills.</p>
</ul>
  
 <h3>Hobbies</h3>
<ul class="b">
  <p>As a hobby I started collecting knick knacks such as magnets and keychains from places my family visits. This started not by me, but by my father since he was often abroad visiting other countries. He often sends me souvenirs, but the thing I mostly look put for is the magnets and keychains. Because of that I started to grow fond of those types of things, I often hang them on my room or at the fridge room. To the point that the door of the fridge is covered fully. This sort of thing really made me happy in the past, well still up to present. I really find them a nice and simple hobby. I do have other hobbies that I do presently, like photographing my pets, teaching them some tricks and reading some general stuffs. As far as I can say this is like the longest hobby that I had. It is still present til now.</p>
</ul>
  
 <h3>Interests</h3>
<ul class="c">
  <p>As for my interest, the oldest thing I can remember that I was mostly interested was with the thing with Power Rangers. I do remember watching them on televisions and I was asking for a suit and things from the show. I remember that my parents bought me the transforming belt from the show. I routine use it daily for like a couple of months before it broke down. Me and my friends were complete in the set for it. We sometimes reenact the show outside while playing. I also remember me having begged for a costume for Robin from Batman. He is also one of my favorites before, well up until today. From Robin to Nightwing, basically the first Robin all grownup. Well those were my interest.</p>
